RapidMiner Extension Template
=============================

A template project for creating a RapidMiner Studio extension. 

### Prerequisite
* Requires Gradle 2.3+ (get it [here](http://gradle.org/installation) or use the Gradle wrapper shipped with this template)

* Rapidminer Studio 7.6 or newer https://my.rapidminer.com/nexus/account/index.html#downloads

### Getting started

1. Clone the extension template

2. ~~Change the extension settings in _build.gradle_ (e.g. replace 'Template' by the desired extension name)~~

3. Initialize the extension project by executing the _initializeExtensionProject_ Gradle task (e.g. via 'gradlew initializeExtensionProject')

4. ~~Add an extension icon by placing an image named "icon.png" in  _src/main/resources/META-INF/_.~~ 

5. Build and install your extension by executing the _installExtension_ Gradle task 

6. Start RapidMiner Studio and check whether the extension has been loaded
